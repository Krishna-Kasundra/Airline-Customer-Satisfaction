SMS Spam Detection Project

-Objective: To build an AI model that classifies SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham).

-Overview: This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers to identify spam messages with high accuracy. The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature transformation, and model evaluation.

-Dataset Name: SMS Spam Collection Dataset

-Techniques Used:

o NLP: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings

o Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)

o Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

-Result: The model demonstrates high accuracy and effectiveness in automating spam detection for text communications.

Accuracy: 98%

Precision: 99%

Recall: 92%

F1-Score: 95%
